# Welcome to the Wallet project repository!

## My comments

This one was the first project in which I used `React` with `Redux`, with that I improved my knowledge about the flow of actions, reducers and store. I also learned how to create asynchronous actions.

## Installation of the project locally

After each of the steps, there will be an example of the command to be typed to do what is being asked, if you have difficulties and the example is not enough, do not hesitate to contact me at _igorln96@gmail.com_.

1. Open the terminal and create a directory in the location of your choice with the command **mkdir**:
``` javascript
   mkdir projects-igorln
```

2. Enter the directory you just created and then clone the project:
``` javascript
   cd projects-igorln
   git clone git@github.com: igorln / wallet.git
```

3. Access the project directory and then use the command **npm i** to install all necessary dependencies:
``` javascript
   cd wallet
   npm i
```

4. Finally, run the command **npm start** and access the project via browser, in the path `http: // localhost: 3000 / wallet`.

# Deliverables

## What should be developed

In this project I had to develop a portfolio of expenses control with currency converter, when using this application a user should be able to:
   - Add and remove an expense;
   - View a table with your expenses;
   - View the total expenses converted to a currency of choice;
